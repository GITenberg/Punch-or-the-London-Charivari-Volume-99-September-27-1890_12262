    <h2>MODERN TYPES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Type Writer.</i>)</h4>

    <h3>No. XIX.&mdash;THE SERVANT OF SOCIETY.</h3>

    <p>The Servant of Society is one who, having in early life
    abdicated every claim to independent thought or action, is
    content to attach himself to the skirts and coat-tails of the
    great, and to exist for a long time as a mere appendage in
    mansions selected by the unerring instinct of a professional
    tuft-hunter. It is as common a mistake to suppose that all
    tuft-hunters are necessarily of lowly birth and of inferior
    social position, as it is to believe them all to be offensive
    in manner and shallow in artifice. The coarse but honest Snob
    still perhaps exists, and here and there he thrusts and pushes
    in the old familiar way; but more often than not the upstart
    who has won his way to wealth and consideration finds himself
    to his own surprise courted and fawned upon by those whose
    boots his abilities would have fitted him to black, and his
    disposition prompted him to lick. Noble sportsmen are proud to
    be seen in his company, aristocratic guinea-pigs are constantly
    in his pocket in the congenial society of the great man's
    purse, art willingly reproduces his features, journalism
    enthusiastically commemorates his adventures, and even Royalty
    does not thrust away a votary whose ministrations are as
    acceptable as they are readily performed. Without much effort
    on his own part he is raised to pinnacles which he imagined
    impossible of access, and soon learns to look down with a
    contempt that might spring of ancient lineage and assured
    merit, upon the hungry crowd whose cry is that of the daughter
    of the horse-leech.</p>

    <p>But the genuine Servant of Society is of a different stamp.
    Ordinarily he is of a good family, and of a competence which
    both differs from and resembles his general character in being
    possessed at once of the attributes of modesty and assurance.
    From an early age he will have been noted for the qualities
    which in after-life render him humbly celebrated in subordinate
    positions. At school he will have had the good fortune to be
    attached as fag to a big boy who occupied an important place as
    an athlete, and whose condescending smiles were naturally an
    object of greater ambition to the small fry than the approval
    of the school authorities. For him he performed with much
    assiduity the various duties of a fag, happy to shine amongst
    his companions as the recipient of the great boy's favours. To
    play the jackal without incurring universal dislike is (at
    school) no very easy task, but he accomplishes it with
    discretion and with a natural aptitude that many maturer
    jackals might envy.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/145.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/145.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>At the age of seventeen he is withdrawn from school. His own
    marked disinclination saves him from a military career, and he
    is subsequently sent to pass a year or two upon the Continent
    of Europe, in order that he may first of all pass the
    examination for the Diplomatic Service, and subsequently foil
    foreign statesmen with their own weapons, and in their own
    language. Returning, he secures his nomination, and faces the
    Examiners. Providence, however, reserves him for lower things.
    The Examiners triumph, and the career of the Servant of Society
    begins in earnest. The position of his parents secures for him
    an entrance into good houses. He is a young man of great tact
    and of small accomplishments. He can warble a song, aid a great
    lady to organise a social festivity, lead a cotillon, order a
    dinner, and help to eat it, act in amateur theatricals, and
    recommend French novels to inquiring matrons. His manners are
    always easy, and his conversation has that spice of freedom
    which renders it specially acceptable in the boudoirs of the
    smart. The experience of a few years makes plain to him that,
    in social matters, the serious person goes down before the
    trifler. He therefore cultivates flippancy as a fine art, and
    becomes noted for a certain cheap cynicism, which he sprinkles
    like a quasi-intellectual pepper over the strong meat of risky
    conversation. Moreover, he is constantly self-satisfied, and
    self-possessed. Yet he manages to avoid giving offence by
    occasionally assuming a gentle humility of manner, to which he
    almost succeeds in imparting a natural air, and he studiously
    refrains from saying or doing anything which, since it may
    cause other men to provoke him, may possibly result in his
    being forced to pretend that he himself has been ruffled. Yet
    it must be added that he is always thoroughly harmless. He
    flutters about innumerable dovecots, without ever fluttering
    those who dwell in them, and, in course of time, he comes to be
    known and accepted everywhere as a useful man. As might be
    supposed, he is never obtrusively manly. The rough pursuits of
    the merely athletic repel him, yet he has the knack of assuming
    an interest where he feels it not, and is able to prattle quite
    pleasantly about sports in which he takes little or no active
    part. At the same time it must be admitted that he holds a gun
    fairly straight, and does not disgrace himself when the
    necessity of slaughtering a friend's pheasants interrupts for a
    few hours the rehearsals of private theatricals, in company
    with the friend's wife. Certainly he is not a fool. He gauges
    with great accuracy his own capacities, and carefully limits
    his ambition to those smaller desires which, since they exact
    no vaulting power, are never likely to bring about a fall on
    the other side. The objects of his admiration are mean; and
    since he meanly admires them, he comes quite naturally under
    the Thackerayan definition of a Snob.</p>

    <p>Whilst he is still a year or two on the fair side of thirty,
    it may happen that a turn of the political wheel will bring
    into high office a statesman who is quite willing to be served
    by those who are able to make themselves useful to him, without
    exacting from them solidity either of character or of
    attainments. With him the Servant of Society, with an instinct
    that does credit to his discernment, will have established
    friendly relations. The politician was first amused and then
    impressed by his versatility; now, having the opportunity, he
    offers to him the position of Assistant Private Secretary
    (unpaid), and it is scarcely necessary to say that the young
    man accepts it with a gratitude which proves that he believes
    his patron capable of conferring further favours. From this
    time forward he begins to abandon the merely frivolous air that
    has hitherto distinguished him. He lays in a mixed stock of
    solemnity, mystery, and importance, and occasionally awes the
    friends of his flippant days by assuming the reticent look and
    the shake of the head of one who is marked off from common
    mortals by the possession of secrets the revelation of which
    might, perhaps, imperil the peace of the world. In
    country-houses, in London drawing-rooms, and at Clubs, where he
    had hitherto been mentioned with a laugh as "Little So-and-So,"
    he comes to be talked of as "So-and-So&mdash;of course you know
    him&mdash;Lord BLANK'S Private Secretary." Thus he becomes
    quite a personage. But he is far from abandoning the
    <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of Servant of Society. Indeed, he only
    enlarges and glorifies the scope of his ministrations, without
    in any way ceasing to cultivate those smaller trifles which
    stood him in such good stead at the outset of his career. He
    now has the satisfaction of seeing many of those who desire
    anything that a Cabinet Minister can give, cringing to one whom
    they despise, and who rejoices in the knowledge that he can
    afford to patronise them, and perhaps crush them by obtaining
    for them that which they want.</p>

    <p>When, in the course of a few years, Lord BLANK'S party
    ceases to direct the government of the country, his Assistant
    Private Secretary follows him into the cold shade of adversity
    and opposition, and stands by him with exemplary usefulness and
    fidelity. But, though he is often pressed, he never contests a
    constituency, feeling, perhaps, that it is impossible to serve
    both Society and the Caucus. In time his name becomes the
    common property of all Society journals&mdash;his biography is
    published in one, his discreet service is extolled in another,
    while a third goes so far as to hint that, if the truth were
    known, it would be found that the various departments of the
    State could not possibly carry on their affairs without his
    enlightened counsel. He adopts an antique fashion of dress, in
    order to emphasise his personality. He wears a stock, and a
    very wide-brimmed hat, and carries a bunch of seals dangling
    from a fob.</p>

    <p>At forty-five he marries the daughter of a powerful Peer,
    and, shortly afterwards, insures so much of the favour of
    Royalty as to be spoken of as a <i>persona grata</i> at Court.
    Henceforward his services are often employed in delicate
    negotiations, which may necessitate the climbing of many
    back-stairs. On such occasions, and after it has been announced
    in the papers that "Mr. So-and-so was the bearer of an
    important communication" from one great person to another, it
    is his custom to show himself in his Clubs and in crowded
    haunts, so that he may enjoy the pleasure of being pointed out,
    <i>digita pr&aelig;tereuntium</i>, and of catching the whispers
    of those who nudge one another as they mention his name.</p>

    <p>Finally, it will be rumoured that he has been collecting
    materials for the Memoirs which he proposes shortly to publish.
    But though he never disclaims the intention, and is even
    understood, on more than one occasion, to allude in
    conversation to the precise period of his life to which his
    writing has then brought him, it is quite certain that he will
    never carry out the intention, or bring out the book. At the
    age of sixty he will still be a young man, with a gay style of
    banter peculiarly his own. Towards the end of his life he will
    often talk darkly of great events in which he has played a
    part, and of extraordinary services which only he could have
    performed; and when he dies, the country will be called upon to
    mourn for one who has saved it from social degradation, and
    from political disaster.</p>

    <p>"NOMINE MUTATO."&mdash;For some weeks there was a

    <p>LATEST FROM THE LYCEUM.&mdash;With a view to supplying the
    entire world with the current number, <i>Mr. Punch</i> goes to

    merely recording that at the initial performance on Saturday
    last all went as happily ("merrily," with so sombre a plot, is
    <i>not</i> the word) as a marriage-bell. There was a striking
    situation towards the end of the drama which was both novel and
    interesting. Mr. IRVING received and deserved a grand
    reception, and it was generally admitted that amongst the many
    admirable impersonations for which MISS ELLEN TERRY is
    celebrated, her <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i> appropriately "takes

    <p>Speaking of <i>Reynart the Fox</i>, I was made, by a slip of
    the printer's hand&mdash;I am accustomed to seeing slips
    <i>from</i> his hand, which is quite another thing&mdash;to say
    that this medi&aelig;val romance "presents a truer picture of
    life than novels in which vice is punished and virtue patiently
    rewarded." After considering for some time what on earth I
    could have meant by "patiently rewarded," I remembered that I
    had written "patently rewarded." The printer put my "i" out;
    and without an "i" it was very difficult to perceive the sense
    of the phrase.</p>

    <p><i>Nutshell Novels</i>, by that crack writer&mdash;no, not
    "crack'd"&mdash;and poet, whose verses send a frill right
    through us, Mr. J. ASHBY-STERRY, are coming out. Capital title.
    As SHAKSPEARE says, "Sermons in stones, novels in nutshells,
    and good in everything." SHELLEY'S poems might be brought out
    in pocketable form under a similar title, <i>Nut-Shelley
    Poems.</i> I have not yet seen the volume in question, only
    heard tell of it, and should not be surprised to hear that the
    central novel and the best was a short military novel, entitled
    <i>The Kernel</i>. Messrs. HUTCHINSON &amp; Co. are the
    publishers. I hope Mr. STERRY has illustrated them himself. He
    can draw and paint, but he won't, and there's an end on't. He
    must follow up the <i>Nutshells</i> with a volume of
    <i>Crackers</i>, about Christmas time.</p>

    <p>Just been looking through <i>London Street Arabs</i>, by
    Mrs. H.M. STANLEY, published by CASSELL &amp; Co., which
    firm&mdash;whose telegraphic address is "Caspeg, London," and a
    good name too&mdash;writes to the Baron thus:&mdash;"<i>In
    forwarding you an early copy</i>"&mdash;small and
    early&mdash;"<i>of Mrs. Stanley's book, we will ask you to be
    good enough</i>"&mdash;("I am 'good enough'" quoth the
    Baron)&mdash;"to <i>confine your extracts from the Introduction
    to an extent not exceeding one-third of the whole</i>."
    "Willingly, my dear 'Caspeg,'" replies the Baron, who does not
    like being dictated to, and, to gratify your wish to the
    utmost, he will make no extracts at all from the book, a
    proceeding which ought mightily to delight "Caspeg, London."
    What next? Will publishers send to the Baron, and request him
    not even to breathe the names of their books? By all means. He
    has no objection, as, whether sent to him for review, or
    purchased by him <i>pour se distraire</i>, the Baron only
    mentions those he likes, or, if he mentions those he dislikes,
    'tis <i>pro bono publico</i>, and there's an end on't. Mrs.
    STANLEY appreciates humour, as the following anecdote will
    show&mdash;But, dear me, the Baron is forgetful&mdash;he begs
    "Caspeg's" pardon; he mustn't quote. Mrs. STANLEY can be truly
    sympathetic with sorrow, as the following story
    proves&mdash;no, "Caspeg," the story must <i>not</i> follow.
    Never mind&mdash;the Baron's dear readers will read it for
    themselves if they feel "so dispoged." The Baron supposes that
    all this was written and drawn while Mrs. STANLEY was Miss
    DOROTHY TENNANT, because her recorded opinion, probably, as a
    spinster, is (and here the Baron "quotes" not, but "alludes"),
    that you can find better artistic material in this line at
    home, than you can obtain by seeking it abroad; yet when she
    married, off she went to Milan, Venice, and so forth. For
    pleasure, of course, not work; but work to her is evidently
    pleasure. May happiness have accompanied her everywhere! The
    drawings are pretty, rather of the goody-good
    "Sunday-at-home-readings" kind of illustrations. And what on
    earth has a sort of pictorial advertisement for "Somebody's
    Soap" got to do with Street Arabs? "<i>Washed Ashore; or, Happy
    At Last</i>," might be the title of this mer-baby picture, in
    which two naked children, not Street Arabs, or Arabs of any
    sort, are depicted as examining the inanimate body of a
    nondescript creature, half flesh and half fish, which has been
    thrown up by the waves "to be left till called for" by the next
    high-tide, when, perhaps, its sorrowing parents, Mr. and Mrs.
    MERMAN, or its widowed mother, Mrs. MERWOMAN, arrayed in
    sea-"weeds," may come to claim it and give it un-christian
    burial. But that the Baron, out of deference to the wishes of
    "Caspeg, London," does not like to quote one single line, he
    could give Mrs. STANLEY'S own account of how this picture of
    the Mer-baby came to be included in the Street Arab Collection.
    For such explanation the Baron refers the reader to the book
    itself. "Caspeg," farewell!</p>

    <p>I have, the Baron says, commenced the first pages of <i>The
    Last Days of Palmyra</i>. Good, so far; but several new books
    have come in, and <i>Palmyra</i> cannot receive my undivided
    attention, says</p>

    <p>THE BARON DE BOOK-WORMS.</p>

    <p>P.S.&mdash;My faithful "Co." has been reading <i>Ferrers
    Court</i>, by JOHN STRANGE WINTER, author of <i>Bootle's
    Baby</i> and a number of other
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"
       id="page149"></a>[pg 149]</span> novelettes of like kind. He
       says that he is getting just the least bit tired of
       <i>Mignon</i>, and the plain-spoken girls, and the rest of
       them. By the way, he observes that it seems to be the
       fashion, judging from the pages of <i>Ferrers Court</i>, in
       what he may call "Service Suckles," to talk continually of a
       largely advertising lady's tailor. If this custom spreads,
       he presumes that the popular topic of conversation, the
       weather, will have to give place to the prior claims for
       consideration of Somebody's Blacking, or Somebody-else's
       Soap. This is to be regretted, as, in spite of the sameness
       of subject of the <i>Bootle's Baby</i> series, JOHN STRANGE
       WINTER is always more amusing than nine-tenths of his (or
       should it be her?) contemporaries. B. De B.-W. &amp; Co.</p>

    <p>P.S. No. 2.&mdash;The Baron wishes to add that on taking up
    the <i>Bride of Lammermoor</i> in order to refresh his memory
    before seeing the new drama, he was struck by a few lines in
    the description of <i>Lucy Ashton</i>, which, during
    rehearsals, must have been peculiarly appropriate to her
    representative at the Lyceum, Miss ELLEN TERRY. Here they
    are:&mdash;"To these details, however trivial, <i>Lucy</i> lent
    patient and not indifferent attention. They moved and
    interested <i>Henry</i>, and that was enough to secure her
    ear." "Great Scott!" indeed! Perfectly prophetic, and
    prophetically perfect. B. DE B.-W.</p>

    <h2>STALKING THE SAGACIOUS STAG.</h2>

    <h4><i>Sporting Notes from Our Special Representative</i>.</h4>

    <p>I had an invite from JEPSON, a Stock Exchange acquaintance,
    who has rented a Moor for the winter months, and who, happening
    to hear that I and my two foreign friends were in the
    neighbourhood, most kindly asked me to come and have a look at
    his box, and bring them with me.</p>

    <p>"I hear," he writes, "that the deer are very lively, and if
    you want to show your foreign friends some first-rate British
    Sport, you can't do better than bring them."</p>

    <p>Need I say that I jumped at this. Coming along on the top of
    the coach, that takes us to Spital-hoo, the place my friend has
    rented, I have been endeavouring to describe what I
    <i>imagine</i> to be the nature of the sport of Deer-stalking
    to the Chief and the Bulgarian Count. The former, who has been
    listening attentively, says that, from my description, stalking
    a stag must be very much the same as hunting the double-humped
    bison in Mwangumbloola, and that the only weapon he shall take
    with him will be a pickaxe. I have pointed out to him that I
    don't think this will be any use, as in deer-stalking I fancy
    you follow the stag <i>at some distance</i>, but he seems
    resolute about the pickaxe, and so, I suppose, I must let him
    have his way. The Bulgarian Count was deeply interested in the
    matter, and says that evidently the proper weapon to use is a
    species of quick-firing, repeating Hotchkiss, and that he has
    one now on its way through Edinburgh, the invention of a
    compatriot, that will fire 2700 two-ounce bullets in a minute
    and a-half. I fancy, if he uses this, he will surprise the
    neighbourhood; but, of course, I have not said anything to
    interfere with his project.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:35%;">
        <a href="images/149-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/149-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>We have arrived at Spital-hoo all safe and sound, and JEPSON
    has given us a most cordial welcome. But I must now have once
    more recourse to my current notes.</p>

    <p>I have now been something like five hours on the tramp,
    plodding my way through a deep glen in a pine forest, but have
    not yet come across any sign of a stag, I started with the
    Chief and the Count, but the former soon went off at a tangent
    somewhere on his own hook, and the latter, who had got his
    Hotchkiss with him and found it heavy work to drag it up and
    down the mountain paths, I have left behind to take a rest and
    recuperate himself. I pause in my walk and listen. The forest
    is intensely still. Not a sign of a stag anywhere.</p>

    <p>JEPSON is left at home, as he is expecting a couple of local
    Ministers to tea, but he has told me I'm "bound to come across
    whole herds of them," if I only tramp long enough. Well, I've
    been at it five hours, and I certainly ought to have spotted
    something by this time. By Jove, though, what's that moving in
    the path ahead of me? It is! <i>It is a stag!</i> A magnificent
    fellow&mdash;though he appears to have only one horn. But, how
    odd! I believe he has seen me, and yet doesn't seem scared!
    Yes, he is actually approaching in the most leisurely fashion
    in the world. But that isn't the correct thing. In
    deer-stalking, I'm sure you ought to stalk the deer, not the
    deer stalk you. And this creature is absolutely coming down on
    me. Oh! I can't stand this. I shall have a shot at him. Bang!
    Have fired&mdash;and <i>missed</i>! And, by Jove, the stag
    doesn't seem to mind! He is coming nearer and nearer. He
    actually comes close to where I am kneeling, and with facetious
    friendliness removes my Tam o'Shanter! But, hulloah! who is
    this speaking? "Ha, and would ye blaze awa wi' your weepons
    upon poor old Epaminondas, mon!" It is an aged Highlander who
    is addressing me, and he has just turned out of a bye-path. He
    is fondling the creature's nose affectionately, and the stag
    seems to know him. I remark as much.</p>

    <p>"Ha! sure he does," he replies, "Why there's nae a body doon
    the glen but has got a friendly word for puir Old Epaminondas.
    You see he's blind o' one 'ee, and he's lost one o' his
    antlers, and he's a wee bit lame, and all the folk here about
    treat him kindly, when ye thought to put that bit o' lead into
    him just noo, sure he was just oomin' to ye for a bit o'
    oatmeal cake."</p>

    <p>I express my regret for having so nearly shot the "Favourite
    of the Glen" through inadvertence! I explain that I came out
    deerstalking, and did not expect, of course, to come across a
    perfectly tame and domestic stag.</p>

    <p>"A weel, there's nae mischief done," continues my
    interlocutor; "but it's nae good a stalking Epaminondas, for
    he's just a sagacious beastie altogether."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Here we are at the Lodge. But, hulloah! what's this uproar
    on the lawn? A herd of deer dashing wildly over everything,
    flowerbeds and all, and, yes, absolutely five of them bursting
    into the house, through one of the drawing-room windows, while
    JEPSON and the two kirk Ministers emerge hurriedly, terrified,
    from the other. Crash! And what's <i>that</i>? Why, surely it
    <i>can't</i> be&mdash;but yes, I believe it is&mdash;yes, it
    <i>positively is</i> the Chief's pickaxe that has flown through
    the air, and just smashed through the upper panes, scattering
    the glass in a thousand fragments in all directions!</p>

    <p>And thus ends my Stalking for the Present, and (probably)
    the Future!</p>

    of land lying waste"&mdash;the very spot for a

    ought to have been a BEERBHOOM TREE. His first drama might have

    <h2>RATS IN COUNCIL.</h2>

    <p>A mass meeting of Rats was held (unknown to the
    Park-keepers) under the Reformer's Oak in Hyde Park, at
    midnight of last Sunday. The object of the gathering was to
    protest against the proposal made by a Correspondent of <i>The
    Times</i>, that the "sewer-rats who had established themselves
    in the sylvan retreat" known as Hyde Park Dell, should be
    exterminated by means of "twenty ferrets and a few capable
    dogs."</p>

    <p>Mr. RODENT (Senior) was called upon to preside. He took the
    hillock amid waving of tails and much enthusiasm, and remarked
    that he trusted that that vast assembly, one of the most
    magnificent demonstrations that even Hyde Park had ever known,
    would show by its orderly behaviour, that Rats knew how to
    conduct business. (<i>Cheers.</i>) They lived in strange times.
    A barbarous suggestion had been made to evict them&mdash;to
    turn them out of house and home, by means of what he might call
    Emergency Ferrets. (<i>Groans, and cries of "Boycott
    them!"</i>) He feared that boycotting a ferret would not do
    much good. (<i>A squeak&mdash;"Why not try
    rattening?"&mdash;and laughter.</i>) Arbitration seemed to him
    the most politic course under the circumstances.
    (<i>Cheers.</i>) They were accused of eating young moor-chicks.
    Well, was a Rat to starve? ("<i>No, no!</i>") Did not a Rat owe
    a duty to those dependent upon it? (<i>Cheers, and cries of
    "Yes!"</i>) He appealed to the opinion of the civilised world
    to put a stop&mdash;At this point in the Chair-rat's address,
    an alarm of "Dogs!" was raised, and the meeting at once
    dispersed in some confusion.</p>

    <p><i>Newgate, September 29, 17&mdash;</i>.&mdash;Got up with
    the assistance of my valet, and held my customary
    <i>lev&eacute;e</i>. The Governor of the place asked my
    permission to enter my luxuriously furnished apartments, to
    show me an amusing set of irons that had been discovered in one
    of the cells used during the last two hundred years for the
    storage of fire-wood. The droll things were called the "Little
    Ease," and seemingly, were intended to create merriment. One of
    the officers was complacent enough to assume them, and caused
    great diversion by his eccentric gestures. My
    <i>lev&eacute;e</i> was not quite so successful, as is
    generally the case, as that tedious old gossip, GUIDO FAUX,
    obtained admission. As usual he had a grievance. It appears
    that a report has got abroad that he was executed in the days
    of our late lamented Monarch, JAMES THE FIRST of Great Britain,
    and SIXTH of Scotland. Says GUIDO, "If this be believed by the
    multitude there will be a demand for my expulsion, and what
    shall I do if I be turned out?" Condoled with him, and escaped
    his importunities by joining with Master JOHN SHEPPARD, and
    Squire TURPIN in a game of "Lorne Ten Hys," a recreation
    recently introduced by my good neighbour Monsieur CLAUDE DU
    VAL. Failed in making a goal, and put out thereat. However,
    regained my usual flow of spirits on receiving a polite request
    from the Governor to join him and his good Dame in a visit to
    the Tower of London, to call upon Lady JANE GREY&mdash;once
    Queen&mdash;and now a guest in that admirable institution. Was
    graciously received by Her Ladyship, who is now of advanced
    age. Her Ladyship was vastly amused at the news that had
    reached her that some chroniclers do insist that she has lost
    her head. "I have in good sooth lost my teeth," laughed the
    venerable gentlewoman "but my head is as firmly set upon my
    shoulders as ever. I do verily believe that it must be some mad
    piece of waggery of that Prince of good fellows, Sir WALTER
    RALEIGH. The aged Knight is always up to some of his nonsense!"
    After playing a game of quoits with Lord BALMARINO and the
    Tower Headsman (whose office is a well-paid sinecure), I
    returned to Newgate, greatly pleased with my morning's
    promenade. In the afternoon, entertained the Governor at
    dinner, who declared that he could never get so good a meal in
    his own quarters. "Strap me, no!" I exclaimed: "and, were it
    not that our food was excellent, who would stay at Newgate?"
    For I confess that, although there are pleasure-gardens, and
    every sort of amusement and comfort, Newgate, at times, is
    decidedly damp. Then I raised a glass of punch to my lips, and
    wished him the same luck that I myself enjoyed. "And that I
    had!" quoth he. "Would I were prisoner instead of Governor. But
    it would not be meet. I am not a man of sufficient quality!"
    And now I must bring this entry to a conclusion, for there is
    to be a theatrical performance in the dining-hall. Little DAVID
    GARRICK is to play the principal male character, while Mistress
    NELLIE GWYNE, Mistress SIDDONS, and Mistress PEG WOFFINGTON,
    are also in the cast. The title of the piece is <i>Hamlet</i>,
    and I am told it is written by a young man new to Town. The
    name of the author is either SHAKSPEARE or SMITH. I am not sure
    which, but think SMITH.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>P.S.&mdash;Open my Diary once again. <i>Hamlet</i> a poor
    piece. It is now said that it was written by BACON or BUCHANAN.
    Of the former I know nothing, and posterity must discover the
    identity of the latter. For the rest, if again I am pressed to
    go to the Play&mdash;strap me! but, comfortable as I am, I will
    pack up my traps, and be off from Newgate&mdash;for ever!</p>

    <h2>THE REAL GRIEVANCE OFFICE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Before</i> Mr. COMMISSIONER PUNCH.)</h4>

    <h4><i>A Shareholder in a Gas Company introduced.</i></h4>

    <p><i>The Commissioner</i> (<i>sharply</i>). Well, Sir, what is
    it?</p>

    <p><i>Shareholder</i>. I have come to complain about the Gas
    Companies&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> I am not surprised. They are generally
    causing some one or other trouble.</p>

    <p><i>Shareh.</i> No, I beg your pardon, Sir, but you
    misunderstand me. I am interested in the prosperity of Gas
    Companies&mdash;</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/156-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/156-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> Then I pity you, for they are certain,
    sooner or later, to be superseded by the Electric Light.</p>

    <p><i>Shareh.</i> Will you allow me to continue? I am annoyed
    that some one has been complaining in the <i>Times</i> that "A
    Chief of a Rental Department" (invariably a person of the
    highest respectability) has a right to the title of "an
    arbitrary cove!"</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> No doubt someone (who showed his wisdom in
    appealing to so powerful a tribunal) gave his reasons?</p>

    <p><i>Shareh.</i> Well, yes; he certainly had been served with
    a demand to pay &pound;1 4<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> within three
    days, to "prevent the necessity" of the gas supply to his
    premises being discontinued at a time when he and his family
    were out of Town, and his house was closed for the recess.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> <i>Prim&acirc; facie</i>, that seems a
    strong order! And I suppose the complainant wrote to the Gas
    Company, and got no redress?</p>

    <p><i>Shareh.</i> Well, yes. But then, you see, this demand for
    payment within three days may have been a final notice.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> (<i>drily</i>). Seems to have been very
    final indeed! Was there anything on the face of the notice to
    distinguish it from an ordinary unstamped circular?</p>

    <p><i>Shareh.</i> No, I believe not. But, then, possibly, the
    account had been submitted to him before.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> How do you know? Speaking from my own
    experience, a demand-note is generally left at the house when
    the master is away, and the Collector does not take the
    slightest trouble to <i>collect</i> the money. He leaves it to
    chance whether the money is <i>sent</i> or not. Surely
    <i>you</i> must know that in your character of a
    householder?</p>

    <p><i>Shareh.</i> Well, yes; I fancy that the collector does
    sometimes act in a very perfunctory manner.</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> And that servants frequently are unable to
    distinguish between the open circular of a Gas Company asking
    for the settlement of an account, and the open circular of a
    touting coal merchant asking for custom? And when this happens,
    both find a home in the dust-hole. Is not that so?</p>

    <p><i>Shareh.</i> Well, yes&mdash;very likely&mdash;but the law
    is&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>The Com.</i> (<i>sternly</i>). The Law and its name
    should not be lightly taken in vain. I have seen on a Gas
    Company's circular the terrors of a statute invoked to secure
    prompt payment of a few shillings! After all, the Gas Companies
    (albeit monopolists) are merely traders, and the Public are the
    customers. If a butcher, a baker, or a candle-stick maker
    invariably attempted to secure immediate payment by reference
    on the invoice to the usefulness of the County Court, it is
    more than possible that that butcher, that baker, or that
    candle-stick maker, would speedily have to retire from business
    <i>vi&acirc;</i> the Bankruptcy column of <i>The London
    Gazette</i>. Thus Gas Companies, who adopt a like unpleasant
    tone, are regarded as the natural enemies of the Public
    generally. You have a grievance&mdash;as a shareholder of one
    of these Associations&mdash;but this is not the place to obtain
    redress. If you want to improve your position, keep your eye
    upon your <i>employ&eacute;s</i>, and teach them the meaning of
    that well-worn phrase, <i>Suaviter in modo, fortiter in re!</i>
    You may go!</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
